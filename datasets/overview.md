# Datasets Overview

This section provides information about working with datasets in TTNet, including input requirements and data analysis.

## What is a Dataset in TTNet?

In TTNet, a dataset is a collection of structured data used for training, validating, and testing machine learning models. Datasets are the foundation of every machine learning project and must meet specific requirements to ensure optimal model performance.

## Dataset Lifecycle

The typical lifecycle of a dataset in TTNet includes:

1. **Preparation**: Prepare data according to input requirements
2. **Ingestion**: Import data into TTNet
3. **Analysis**: Analyze data to understand its characteristics
4. **Transformation**: Transform data to meet model requirements
5. **Versioning**: Track different versions of datasets
6. **Usage**: Use datasets for model training and validation
7. **Maintenance**: Update datasets as needed

## Key Dataset Features

TTNet provides several features for working with datasets:

1. **Multiple Format Support**: Import data from various file formats
2. **Automated Analysis**: Automatically analyze dataset characteristics
3. **Feature Type Detection**: Identify and categorize feature types
4. **Data Quality Assessment**: Evaluate dataset quality
5. **Column Drop Analysis**: Identify columns that may be candidates for removal
6. **Metadata Generation**: Create comprehensive metadata for datasets
7. **Integration**: Seamless connection with model training pipelines

## Understanding Your Data

Before using a dataset for training models, it's essential to understand:

- **Input Requirements**: What format and structure your data should have
- **Data Characteristics**: The properties of your features
- **Quality Issues**: Potential problems that might affect model performance
- **Necessary Transformations**: Changes needed to optimize your data
