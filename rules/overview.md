# Rules Overview

This section provides information about rules and rule validation in TTNet.

## What are Rules in TTNet?

Rules in TTNet are interpretable logical statements extracted from trained models that represent the decision-making patterns learned by the models:

- **Rule Structure**: Rules consist of conditions and outcomes expressed in a human-readable format
- **Rule Generation**: Rules are automatically generated from trained models
- **Rule Application**: Rules can be applied to new data for prediction
- **Rule Validation**: Rules are validated against test datasets to ensure accuracy
- **Rule Usage**: Rules provide insights into model behavior and enable model explainability

## Key Rule Features

TTNet provides several features for working with rules:

1. **Rule Language**: A flexible language for representing complex rules
2. **Rule Repository**: Centralized storage for all rules
3. **Validation Tools**: Tools for testing rules against datasets
4. **Integration**: Seamless integration with datasets and models
5. **Version Control**: Track changes and maintain rule history

## Rule Generation Process

Rules in TTNet are generated through a systematic process:

1. **Model Training**: A model (typically TTNet model) is trained on the dataset
2. **Rule Extraction**: The trained model's decision boundaries are converted into logical rules
3. **Rule Pruning**: Rules are simplified and optimized for readability and performance
4. **Rule Storage**: Generated rules are stored in a database with links to their source models
5. **Rule Application**: Rules can be used for inference on new data
